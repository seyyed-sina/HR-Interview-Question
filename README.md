## Greeting

Hello, how are you today? Nice to meet you.

So for today’s meeting, I’ve done a lot of research already and I am excited to learn more about the company and introduce myself.

I think it is a good opportunity for me, for my career, and for improving my skills.

## Tell me about yourself.

Nice to meet you and thank you for giving me a chance to introduce myself.

My name is (Jack) and I live in (Virginia).

I graduated from the (University of Virginia) in (2015) with a (bachelor’s) degree in (computer science). I was crazy about computer programming in high school so I studied computer science in university by learning the basics like HTML5, CSS3, and javascript.

My interests are in (Front End Engineering), and I love to create beautiful and performant products with delightful user experiences.

My main stacks are (frontend) frameworks and libraries such as (React, Redux, Typescript, Next.js, Angular and CSS frameworks like Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS, UI libraries like material UI, Ant design), and so on.

I am also familiar with unit testing, and e2e testing, especially I am familiar with jest and cypress for testing.

My last position ended last month; So I am actively looking for a new opportunity.

## Why did you start a web development?

- I started web development because I love both creativity and technology.
- Making websites lets me turn my ideas into something real that people can use.
- I got interested in this during a college class where I learned how to code.
- I enjoy learning new things all the time since web development changes so quickly.
- It’s very satisfying to see my work help businesses and make life easier for users.

## Why are you interested in this opportunity?

- Well, I’ve looked first at the company and am very impressed that it was founded by three passionate people and even if it has only 8 years of history and it’s growing fast as one of the most efficient and excellent companies.
- And I am also really passionate about the work you are doing in (XXX) areas, so I was very excited to apply.
- And the required skills match well with the skills I have.
- I saw your main toolkit was React and React is one of my most powerful points.
- It looks like a good opportunity for me to contribute to the company's missions as well as a great next move for my career.

## What are your strengths?

- **Problem-Solving Skills:** I excel at breaking down complex issues and finding effective solutions. For example, in my previous project, we faced a significant bug that was causing the website to crash. I methodically diagnosed the issue, identified the root cause, and implemented a fix that resolved the problem efficiently.
- **Adaptability:** I can quickly learn new technologies and adapt to changing environments. For instance, when our team decided to switch from one framework to another, I swiftly got up to speed with the new technology and helped the team transition smoothly without any delays in the project timeline.
- **Attention to Detail:** I pay close attention to details, ensuring my work is accurate and of high quality. For example, when developing a client’s e-commerce site, I carefully tested every feature to ensure a seamless user experience, which significantly reduced post-launch issues and improved customer satisfaction.

## What are your weaknesses?

- **Perfectionism:** I tend to spend too much time trying to perfect every detail of a project. For instance, I sometimes get caught up in minor design tweaks, which can delay the overall progress. I'm working on balancing attention to detail with meeting deadlines by setting clear priorities and time limits for tasks.
- **Delegating Tasks:** I find it challenging to delegate tasks because I like to ensure everything is done correctly. In a previous project, I tried to handle too many responsibilities myself, which led to burnout. I’m learning to trust my team more and delegate tasks based on their strengths.
- **Public Speaking:** I’m not very comfortable with public speaking and presenting in front of large groups. During team meetings, I used to feel nervous explaining my ideas. To improve, I’ve been taking public speaking courses and practicing in smaller settings to build my confidence.

## Do you prefer working independently or on a team?

I like both working alone and working with a team. When I work alone, I can focus better and get things done quickly. For example, I can concentrate on writing code without any distractions.

But I also enjoy working with a team because we can share ideas and solve problems together. For instance, when we work together, we can come up with better solutions than working alone.

So, I think a mix of both is the best way to work.

## Tell us about a challenge you’ve faced and how you handled it.

- At my previous job, we faced a challenging deadline when my boss was away for the day. A client needed the project delivered by 5:00 PM, and we were behind schedule. I stepped up to lead the project, strategically delegating tasks among four team members based on their individual strengths. After reorganizing my own responsibilities, I dedicated my full day to the project. Through our coordinated efforts, we successfully delivered on time. This experience led to more leadership opportunities and helped me develop stronger project management skills.
- I've faced numerous challenges throughout my career and successfully overcome them all. One recent example stands out. We encountered an SEO issue with our Single Page Application (SPA) built using React. While frameworks like Gatsby and Next.js offer Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG), adopting them wasn't feasible due to our extensive existing React codebase. Updating the entire project with a new framework would have been too time-consuming and resource-intensive.
    
    We brainstormed for more efficient solutions and eventually discovered one that fit our needs perfectly. We implemented the react-snap node module, which supports SSG. This approach allowed us to address our SEO concerns without overhauling our entire codebase.
    
    The project launch was a resounding success, thanks to this innovative solution. It was an incredibly rewarding moment for me, both professionally and personally. 
    
    This experience not only solved our immediate problem but also demonstrated our team's ability to think creatively and adapt to challenges.
    

## Why are you left your job?

My last job finished because the project I was working on came to an end.

After completing my responsibilities and contributing to the project's success, there were no further tasks for me to undertake, so my employment naturally concluded.

So I am actively looking for new opportunities.

## What are you looking for in your next job?

- The things that I am looking for in my next job are a **collaborative**, **team-focused culture, opportunities to learn and grow** my skills from a technical standpoint, and a **chance to learn more leadership skills** over time. After researching the company, I realized that it looks like a good match for what I am looking for, so I was excited to come to the interview.
- In my next job, I'm looking for a company that shares my values and provides opportunities for growth and development. Specifically, I'm looking for a workplace where teamwork is valued and where there is a culture of open communication and collaboration. I'm also seeking a company that is committed to making a positive impact on the world and takes its corporate social responsibility seriously.
- In terms of growth and development, I'm looking for a company that encourages its employees to take on new challenges and provides opportunities for continued learning and development. I value a workplace that invests in its employees and helps them to grow both personally and professionally.

## What type of work environment do you prefer?

- I prefer a work environment that is collaborative and supportive.
- I like working in a place where everyone respects each other and helps one another. For example, a friendly and inclusive atmosphere where people feel comfortable sharing ideas and asking for help when needed.
- Additionally, I appreciate a work environment that offers flexibility, such as the option to work remotely or adjust hours when necessary. This allows me to balance work and personal life effectively.
- Overall, I thrive in an environment that fosters teamwork, communication, and mutual respect.

## Are you applying for other jobs?

- Yes, I'm actively seeking new opportunities that allow me to contribute my skills and experience effectively.
- I'm open to exploring different industries and roles that align with my career objectives and offer room for growth.

## What are you passionate about?

My biggest passion is learning about software and technology.

I was fascinated with computers from a young age, so I decided to study Computer Science in college and I have continued in that direction since graduating.

I’m always looking to challenge myself and learn new things.

## What do you think about code review?

The code review improves code quality by detecting issues before they snowball out of control and ensuring consistent standards.

This leads to robust software that is built from components for seamless integration and functionality.

## What makes you stressed while working on a team?

Some of the many causes of work-related stress include long hours, heavy workloads, job insecurity, and conflicts with co-workers or bosses. Symptoms include a drop in work performance, depression, anxiety, and sleeping difficulties.

## How do you make decisions?

I typically list out all available options and then weigh the pros and cons and expected outcomes from each.

Sometimes a peer will point out a pro or con that I hadn't seen, so I find it helpful to talk to others when appropriate.

After this, I will choose the course of action that I feel is most likely to bring about the best outcome.

I also weigh the risks of each possible decision.

If one decision has a good potential outcome but comes with too much risk for the company, then it may not be the right choice.

## **Can you tell me about a time you failed and how you handled it?**

I once underestimated the time required for a project, which led to a delayed delivery. I learned to build more buffer time into my estimates and communicate proactively with stakeholders.

## **What do you like to do in your free time?**

In my spare time, I enjoy (hiking) and (exploring the outdoors). It's a great way for me to get some exercise, clear my mind, and connect with nature.

I also enjoy (reading books) about (history) and (biographies of inspiring people), as I find them very informative and thought-provoking. Also, I like to spend time with my friends and family, trying out new restaurants or watching movies together.

## **Where do you see yourself** in next 5 years**?**

- Over the next few years, I aim to develop my project management skills. Within five years, I envision myself leading significant projects for major clients. To achieve this goal, I'll actively seek opportunities to expand my responsibilities within my current role. Ultimately, I aspire to become a project manager, team leader, or CTO in the next five years.
- In the next five years, I see myself growing both professionally and personally. Professionally, I am excited to continue to build my skills and expertise in web development. I aim to take on more challenging projects and work with new technologies to expand my knowledge and experience.
- I see myself taking on more leadership roles and mentoring junior developers to help them achieve their potential. As I progress in my career, I hope to become a valuable asset to my team and the company as a whole.

## **How do you handle stress or tight deadlines?**

- Stress... as you know, meeting the deadline is very important for us, I mean, software engineers. But, another important thing is the quality of production. I prefer both of us, but I put more importance on quality.
    
    So if the deadline is too tight, I explain why I can not meet the deadline and why the quality is important, what else, and how we can find an optimized way to build a perfect production. And also discuss it with teammates.
    
- Stress and tight deadlines are part of the job for web developers, and I've developed a few strategies over the years to help me manage these challenges.
    
    First and foremost, I prioritize my workload and create a detailed task list, breaking down larger projects into smaller, more manageable tasks.
    
    This helps me stay focused and ensures that I'm making progress, even when things feel overwhelming.
    
    I'm also a big believer in the power of communication.
    
    If I'm feeling stressed or if I'm worried that I won't be able to meet a deadline, I make sure to communicate that with my team or project manager as soon as possible.
    
    This way, we can work together to find a solution and come up with a plan that works for everyone.
    
- I prioritize my tasks and break them into manageable steps to avoid feeling overwhelmed.
    
    For example, during a tight deadline, I create a detailed schedule and tackle one task at a time, which helps me stay focused and calm.
    
    I also make sure to take regular breaks to clear my mind, whether it's a short walk or a few minutes of deep breathing.
    
    Additionally, I find that regular exercise and hobbies outside of work, like reading or playing a musical instrument, help me recharge and keep my stress levels in check. This approach allows me to remain productive and maintain my well-being even during high-pressure situations.
    
- In my previous job, I was tasked with completing a complex project that had a tight deadline.
    
    To manage the deadline effectively, I created a project plan that included a timeline of tasks and deadlines, which I reviewed and updated regularly.
    
    I also made sure to prioritize tasks based on their importance and worked with my team to delegate tasks and manage our time efficiently.
    
    Throughout the project, I communicated regularly with stakeholders to manage expectations and address any concerns or issues that arose.
    
    As a result of our planning and collaboration, we were able to complete the project on time and to the satisfaction of our client.
    

## What is your experience working in a team?

I have extensive experience working as a team player on various projects. For example, during my previous job, I was part of a team that developed a new website for a client.

As a team player, I made sure to communicate effectively with my team members, to listen to their feedback, and contribute to the project's success.

I also used my problem-solving skills to help resolve any conflicts that arose within the team. Thanks to our strong teamwork skills, we were able to complete the project on time and within budget, to the satisfaction of our client.

## **How do you manage conflict with coworkers?**

- Good point. As you know, managing conflicts is very important in teamwork. So in that case, I find the part of the conflict and take some time to review it. And after that, I discussed with my teammates who wrote that part to manage these conflicts. After a deep discussion, we can handle the conflicts together.
- Conflicts can be challenging, but I believe that open and honest communication is key to resolving them. When a conflict arises, I try to remain calm and approach the situation with empathy and understanding. I believe it's important to listen to the other person's perspective and work together to find a mutually beneficial solution.
- If the conflict is related to a specific project or task, I try to get everyone on the same page by clearly defining roles and responsibilities, setting realistic deadlines, and providing regular progress updates. This helps to ensure that everyone is working toward the same goal and reduces the likelihood of misunderstandings or conflicts arising.
- If the conflict is related to a more personal issue, I try to approach the situation in a non-judgmental way and focus on finding a resolution that works for everyone involved. I believe that it's important to remain respectful and professional, even in difficult situations.
- Ultimately, my goal is to find a solution that addresses the root cause of the conflict and enables everyone to move forward positively and productively.

## What does it mean to be a Senior Developer?

In my opinion, a senior software developer is a professional with 4 to 10+ years of experience in the job.

They're capable of writing complex applications and have a deep understanding of the entire application lifecycle, services, and databases.

They are comfortable working in any area of the application.

## Describe a conflict you had with a team member and how you resolved it.

During a previous project, I was working on a team with another developer who had a different approach to solving a technical problem than I did. We had differing opinions on the best way to approach the problem, which led to some tension and conflict between us.

To resolve the conflict, I first made an effort to listen to the other developer's perspectives and understand their reasoning for their approach. I tried to approach the conversation with empathy and respect and focused on finding common ground between us.

We also decided to collaborate more closely on the project, breaking down the problem into smaller pieces and assigning tasks based on each of our strengths. This helped us to focus on our contributions and minimized the potential for conflict.

Ultimately, we were able to work together to find a solution that incorporated elements of both of our approaches, which resulted in a better outcome than either of us could have achieved alone.

Looking back, I learned the importance of communication and collaboration in resolving conflicts. By actively listening to the other developer's perspectives and finding common ground, we were able to overcome our differences and work together more effectively.

## How would your boss and coworkers describe you?

**Reliable:** My boss and coworkers would describe me as reliable. I consistently meet deadlines and deliver high-quality work. For example, during a critical project, I was entrusted with managing key tasks, and I ensured everything was completed on time and met our quality standards.

**Team Player:** They would also describe me as a team player. I collaborate well with others and am always willing to lend a hand. In a recent team project, I frequently helped my colleagues troubleshoot issues and share insights, which helped us complete the project successfully.

**Proactive:** Additionally, my boss and coworkers would say I am proactive. I don’t wait for problems to arise; I anticipate potential issues and address them early. For instance, I often propose new tools or processes that could improve our workflow, leading to increased efficiency in our projects.

## **Would you rather work alone or with a team?**

- Of course, in a team. As you know, anyone can not do anything alone because everyone has limited knowledge and experience.
    
    So, without any help, without any collaboration, you are nothing. That's my phrase. haha.
    
- I enjoy both. I appreciate the collaboration and diverse perspectives that come with teamwork, but I'm also comfortable working independently to meet individual goals.

## What are your salary expectations?

- I am open to discussing what you believe to be a fair salary for the position. However, based on my skills and experience and on the current industry rates I am looking at my salary at around (($70-80) per hour, ($10k - $15k) per month.
- Actually, I am negotiable with salary discussions.

## **What is your notice period? When can you start a new position?**

- I can start immediately since I am unemployed right now.
- I don’t have any notice period since I left my last company.
